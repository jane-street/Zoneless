It includes checkout, subscriptions, marketplace accounts, and payouts through a Stripe-compatible API. Use the full platform or add it alongside your current payment setup.

## A familiar API

Zoneless uses familiar resources such as Checkout Sessions, Payment Links, Customers, Products, Subscriptions, Accounts, Transfers, and Payouts. It also follows Stripe's object shapes, webhook patterns, and idempotency model.

If you have worked with Stripe before, the SDK should feel familiar:

```typescript
import { Zoneless } from '@zoneless/node';
const client = new Zoneless('sk_live_z_YOUR_API_KEY', 'https://api.zoneless.com');

const session = await client.checkout.sessions.create({
  success_url: 'https://yoursite.com/success',
  cancel_url: 'https://yoursite.com/cancel',
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: 'usdc',
        unit_amount: 1000,
        product_data: { name: 'My first product' },
      },
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  mode: 'payment',
});
```

The API covers checkout, subscriptions, and marketplace payouts. See the [API reference](https://docs.zoneless.com) for the full list of resources and endpoints.

## Running in production

Zoneless was built for [PromptBase](https://promptbase.com), an AI marketplace with more than 500,000 users, and runs its seller payout infrastructure in production.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zonelessdev/zoneless.git
cd zoneless
docker compose up -d
```

Open [localhost/setup](http://localhost/setup) to create your platform account and API key.

See the [self-hosting guide](https://docs.zoneless.com/self-hosting) for configuration, credentials, and deployment options.
